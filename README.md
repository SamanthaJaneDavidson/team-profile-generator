# Team Profile Generator	

## Description 
The goal of this project was to create a team profile generator using the node.js inquirer module. Users are prompted with questions to complete a team roster, including the team's manager, engineers, and interns. Each employee will have a profile displayed on an HTML page which is generated from the JavaScript file. Each class (employee, manager, engineer, and intern) also has associated test scenarios. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js
